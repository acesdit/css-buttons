<!-- This CSS code styles a horizontal navigation bar with smooth hover effects. Each navigation link is highlighted by a gradient-colored moving background (the span element), which dynamically shifts under the links when hovered. The highlight begins at the first link (Home) and moves smoothly between links with a subtle transition effect. Each link adjusts the width of the background span based on its content, enhancing the hover effect and user experience. The minimalistic design features a dark background and vibrant gradient, making it visually appealing and easy to interact with. -->
